Root tests folder is reserved for testing functions and modules that use scientific data. For general module unit tests, use module tests folder.  

Usage:  
- Put test scripts in either tests/ or spinifel/tests (module tests)  
- Update test_main.py to include the new tests. Note that pytest ONLY picks up tests from test_main.py.
